# Fashion_MNIST
This project uses Python and PyTorch to build a model capable of recognizing fashion items.
The goal is to demonstrate image classification techniques on a simple but popular dataset, making it perfect for learning and experimentation.

## Features

* Loads and preprocesses the Fashion MNIST dataset
* Trains a neural network classifier
* Evaluates model accuracy and performance
* Visualizes predictions for sample images
